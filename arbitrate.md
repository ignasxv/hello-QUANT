arbitrate | *free money*, taking advantage of price differences in the financial market .. *e.g bitcomins was prices at $10K in us while it rradesd fro $15k in North Korea* - **The Kimchi Premius**
**Bellman-ford** | - it accounts for negatives weighs unlike the djikras, in different nodes, bellman-ford algorithms allow us to find the tatal minum/maximum path to exchange and get back to the original node (you want to return to the original node) - an existence of a -ve in the cycle indicates the existance of a *arbitrate opportunity*
**mean reversion** | it assumes that prces between assets will tend toward zero instead offgoing further (*it will revert toward the mean - it's intrisic value*)  [plexit](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/bell-ford-algorightm-ZpU1Or7_RRmQckZ3Rq88ug) `in practice this prices divergence nly lasts for a few seconds` and here is where HFT arises
**asset intrinsic value** | 
**Electrion markets** | 
**Favorite longshot-bias** | betters overvalue the evnets with low probability and undervalue thos with higher probabilities - this is mostly dues to cognitive bias and market innefficiencies
